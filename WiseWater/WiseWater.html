            <p class="aboutMe">
                I recently graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from Wichita State University, looking to begin my career in technology. 
                I have very strong problem solving and critical thinking skills, and a drive for continuous improvement.

                WiseWater is an award-winning mobile application that was developed by myself, Marcos Vera Bareiros, and Eric Matthews to help those with fluid restriction diets keep track of their total fluid intake.

                    The home screen of WiseWater shows the fluid meter along with the limit and current total. 
                    The limit is set by the user in settings, and fluids can be added either by the "Add Fluids" button, which is a free input, 
                    the "Quick Add" button, which leads to preset values, or by searching for a food.

                <p class="description">
                    The "Quick Add" screen has 6 preset buttons, and 2 custom buttons that can be set to match the user's favorite bottle or drink. 
                    The custom button values are saved in the device's persistent storage, along with the Max Fluid value.

                    If fluids are added that puts the user over their daily limit, the blue fluid bar will be completely filled, and a red bar will begin to populate the fluid meter.

                    Users can view their past history by clicking on the "View History" button in the top left. 
                    History can be filtered by the past week, month, or all time, and indicates whether or not the user was within their daily limit they had set for that day. 
                    The history page is implemented by a SQLite database, which was chosen for its lightweight nature and simple integration with .NET/C#.

                    The major, unique feature of this application is the ability for users to easily account for fluids consumed as foods. 
                    This feature allows for more accurate, complete tracking. This data is pulled from USDA FoodData Central using their API endpoint. 
                    This is an example search for "Apples", which populates a large list of different apple products, and their fluid content.

                    When an entry is clicked on, it populates the screen with common portion sizes if available. 
                    A user can then click on a portion, and enter how many portions they would like to add to the meter. 
                    Alternatively, they can simply add how much they consumed by clicking the "Custom amount" button.

                Overall, developing WiseWater was an incredibly enriching experience that gave me a lot of insight into the software development process as a whole. 
                As the project's lead developer, I was personally responsible for most of the application and am very proud of how it turned out. 
                At the completion of the project, it was presented at Wichita State University's 2024 Engineering Open House, where it won the Most Life Changing Award.
